3. **TransactionDetailsModal** - Comprehensive transaction details view
4. **ConfettiParticle** - Individual confetti animation particles
5. **CelebrationIcon** - Floating celebration icons with animations

### Integration

The enhanced payment completion system integrates seamlessly with the existing payment processing workflow:

```tsx
// In payment-processing.tsx
if (showReceipt && receipt) {
  return (
    <EnhancedPaymentCompletion
      receipt={receipt}
      onNewTransaction={completeTransaction}
      onPrintReceipt={() => window.print()}
      onEmailReceipt={async (email, message) => {
        // Email implementation
      }}
      onSMSReceipt={async (phone, message) => {
        // SMS implementation  
      }}
      onViewDetails={() => {
        // Optional custom details handler
      }}
      onDownloadPDF={() => {
        // PDF generation
      }}
      autoAdvanceSeconds={30}
    />
  )
}
```

### Dependencies

- **Framer Motion**: For all animations and transitions
- **Lucide React**: For consistent iconography
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **React Hook Form**: For form handling in dialogs
- **Zustand Stores**: For sound management and settings

## Configuration Options

### Auto-Advance Timer
```tsx
autoAdvanceSeconds={30} // Set to 0 to disable
```

### Sound Effects
Controlled via the `useSound` hook and can be configured in the settings store.

### Theming
All colors and styling follow the existing MAPOS theme with purple/pink gradients and dark mode support.

## Browser Compatibility
